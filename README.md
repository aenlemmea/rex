# PLEASE NOTE

This is my first Rust Project while learning the language. Basically, this repo is all my experience with rust. I was either guessing syntax, or using LLMs, so this project is not suitable for any usage whatsoever. This is mostly me messing around the concepts. 


## Rex

A micro web framework in Rust. Mostly for learning purposes. Somewhat "Actor based" in design.

## Running

Run the sample with: `cargo run --bin sample`


The directort `old_sample` is mostly documenting the evolution of the code through the samples. Eventually they became obsolete (and non-compatible) hence were moved there.
